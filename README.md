## Notable Projects

1. **Stock Volatility Analysis Using GARCH Model**
    - **Description**: In this project, a GARCH(2,1) model was applied to analyze volatility in key tech stocks (AAPL, MSFT, NVDA) and the NASDAQ Composite Index (^IXIC). The data preprocessing involved stationarity checks and differencing to make the time series suitable for GARCH modeling. The model revealed strong volatility persistence (β > 0.70) and a significant impact of market shocks (α), indicating substantial time-dependent risk factors in these assets. To validate the model, a Ljung-Box test was performed on the residuals, confirming minimal autocorrelation and ensuring that the model effectively captured the volatility patterns without leaving out any predictable structure. These findings highlight the utility of GARCH modeling for accurate financial time series analysis.

2. **Portfolio Risk Analysis and Optimization**
    - **Description**: This project involves using a Random Forest Regressor to predict SOFI stock prices, achieving a Mean Squared Error (MSE) of 0.55, which indicates strong predictive accuracy. Additionally, Monte Carlo simulations and Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) analysis were applied to optimize a diversified portfolio. The portfolio analysis provided key insights into risk-adjusted returns, with calculated alpha and beta values reflecting the portfolio’s sensitivity to market movements relative to Nasdaq and S&P 500.
